For Android: Use flutter build apk --split-per-abi (split APK by ABI) or flutter build appbundle (recommended for publishing to Play Store) and check the size of the generated files in your build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/ or build/app/outputs/bundle/release/ directory.
For iOS: Use flutter build ios and then archive the app using Xcode to create a release version. You can inspect the size of the final IPA file through Xcode's Organizer after archiving.

flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release
